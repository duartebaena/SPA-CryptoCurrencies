# SPA with Crypto Currencies real-time data 
## Brief resume:
* SPA that consumes an API with Crypto Currencies real-time data and displays it.
* When entering the app you have a button to show stats from 100 coins. "The maximum result is 100 coins per request" Or you can click in the crypto logos displayed beneath the button, and it will show you the stats from that specific coin.
* **API** used to fetch data: "https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api"
* Programming language: **JavaScript**
* Markup Languages: **HTML**, **CSS**
* Design pattern: Model View Controller **(MVC)**


### This is a Minimum Value Proposition (MVP), for the future I will try to add new features.
* It was implemented as a extra challenge while I was studying at Code For All_
